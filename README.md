Unsupervised machine learning – Member of the “Dendrotrons” team to work on the Allstate Claims Severity Kaggle Challenge.  Among other duties, I used hierarchical clustering to generate various dendrograms to find possible grouping of states against loss.  In order to make sense of Allstate’s highly secretive data, I only derived high level knowledge based on basic statistics.

Recommender system in Python – Team of three created “BookLab: Helping you discover new books…” which started with the Book-Crossing dataset. Among other duties, I performed imputation on implicit ratings, and implemented Collaborative Filtering using distance-based similarity scoring.
