[The Skyscraper Center](https://skyscrapercenter.com) publishes various information about world's skyscrapers.  For example,the [100 Tallest Completed Buildings in the World by Height to Architectural Top](https://skyscrapercenter.com/buildings).

## [100 Tallest Completed Buildings in the World by Height to Architectural Top](https://skyscrapercenter.com/buildings) 
The page even includes a downloadable PDF: <br>

## Tallest now is [Burj Khalifa](https://skyscrapercenter.com/building/burj-khalifa/3)
However, some data, like year Proposed and Construction Start, only available in secondary pages:<br>

## Statistics about these 100 skyscrapers:

* Usages
    + `r length(tall100$isMultiPurpose[tall100$isMultiPurpose=='Y'])` are multipurpose.
    + `r length(tall100$forOffice[tall100$forOffice=='Y'])` are used for office.
    + `r length(tall100$forHotel[tall100$forHotel=='Y'])` are used for hotel.
    + `r length(tall100$forResidential[tall100$forResidential=='Y'])` are used for residential.
    + `r length(tall100$forRetail[tall100$forRetail=='Y'])` are used for retail. 
<br>    
* Totals
    + `r sum(tall100$blgFloor)` floors.
    + `r sum(tall100$hgtFeet)` feet.
<br>

## Time
* `r sum(is.na(tall100$yrPropose))` do not have Proposed Year listed.
* `r sum(is.na(tall100$yrStart))` do not have Construction Start Year listed.
* From Proposed To Construction Start:
    + Cannot compute `r sum(is.na(tall100$tmProposeStart))`.
    + Shortest took `r min(tall100$tmProposeStart[!is.na(tall100$tmProposeStart)])` year.
    + Longest  took `r max(tall100$tmProposeStart[!is.na(tall100$tmProposeStart)])` year.
* <font color="red">From Construction Start To Complete:</font> 
    + Cannot compute `r sum(is.na(tall100$tmStartComplete))`.    
    + <font color="red">Shortest took<em> `r min(tall100$tmStartComplete[!is.na(tall100$tmStartComplete)])` </em>year.</font>
    + Longest  took `r max(tall100$tmStartComplete[!is.na(tall100$tmStartComplete)])` year.
